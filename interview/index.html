		<p class="question">
			1. You were one of the early experimenters of Net Art. How did you begin thinking of the Internet as system to deliver art? What were its pros and cons in relation to more traditional methods like a museum or a gallery?
		</p>

		<p class="answer">
			I learned about internet in the early 90s. I remember the very excitement of going to Columbia university to check on Muntadas' <a href="http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/CategoryHomePage.html" target="_blank"> The File Room, </a>considered to be the early net art made in Mosaic browser. I have worked with interactive installation <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/color-schemes" target="_blank"> Color Schemes </a> (1990) <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/those-fluttering-objects-desireshort-version" target="_blank">Those Fluttering Objects of Desire</a> (1992-1993) and started using BBS (bulletin board system) to research my feature film <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/fresh-kill" target="_blank"> FRESH KILL </a>(1994) on eco-cybernoia. Border crossing power hacking were the themes. I did not want to confine myself in closed-circuit white room, black box.  As the Net arrived and made accessible,  I packed my bag (one carry on bag), declared my homesteading at cyberspace and announced my digital nomad existence. 
		</p>
		<br>

		<p class="question">
			2. You explore the possibility of assuming different identities on the Internet. Can you explain this interest? 
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
			The Net promised communication superhighway, MCI at the time was quick to proclaim the internet's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioVMoeCbrig" target="_blank">erasure of race and gender</a>. I had much doubts about this. As we uploaded ourselves onto constructed virtual living spaces - chatrooms, MOOs (LambdaMOO), picking up avatar representations, making up handles as passports, we were quick to confront ID scan on race and gender. In 1998, I launched <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/15337" target="_blank">BRANDON</a>, a One-Year Narrative Project in Installments explores issues of gender fusion and techno-body in both public space and cyberspace. There were two actual incidents occurred in 1993 that informed the making of BRANDON - the story of Brandon Teena, a transman who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska and a rape in cyberspace reported by Julian Dibbell in the Village Voice. Brandon is confined in a gendered body, while the cyber-rape is in full public view taking pace at virtual living room of LambdaMOO. This work comprised of several interfaces includes Mooplay where one chats with bots and get messed up on id politics.

		<p class="question">
			3. How far you do you see this multiple shifting personae via the Internet evolving in the future? How do you see this relate to something like Facebook, which creates an identity that is forever attached to your name?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
			The advance of social network, the corporate take over of the Net, signal the selfie generation. We have (un)willingly turned ourselves into digital slaves in providing data contents. The multi-personae has bulit into our own virtual bodies, there is no fun to masquerade anymore. We have been merged into a single identity through cross-breeding of social networks. Try to commit facebook suicide, sell your facebook friends,  turn off the cookies, send your mobile on a slow boat to China........
		</p>

		<br>

		<p class="question">
			4. What interests you most about interactivity? Is it a way for you to incorporate the range of human complexity? 
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
			We are trigger happy animals, functioning on impulses, interactions, actions and reactions. In my early work, <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/color-schemes" target="_blank"> Color Schemes</a> (1990) uses coin operated washing machines as medium, <a href="http://www.vdb.org/titles/those-fluttering-objects-desireshort-version" target="_blank">Those Fluttering objects of Desire</a> (1992-1993) uses porno view booths, both works requires a quarter (25 cent coin) to operate. In Bowling Alley (1995), I moved onto interaction between 3 spaces - bowling lane, gallery and web, each with different public presence, unknowingly activating chain reactions. The Locker Baby project, including 3 part&mdash; <a href="http://www.babywork.biz/proposal/lockerbaby-3parts.pdf" target="blank">Baby Love</a> (2005) and <a href="http://www.babywork.biz/html/sonic-simulation.html" target="blank">Baby Work</a> (2012) accounts human's conciliation with coin locker bred clone babies and their acquired ME (memory Emotion) data. My recent work <a href="https://vimeo.com/112516427" target="_blank"> UKI-enter the Bionet </a> (2004 release) retrieves body data (blood pressure, heartbeats) as hacking codes.
			<br>http://u-k-i.co/distribution/uki_enterthebionet_en.pdf
			<br>
			<br>Ultimately, I am dealing with human material machine factor ( a theme of my mentoring bock in DasArts Amsterdam 2002).
		</p>

		<br>

		<p class="question">
			5. Any ideas on how the Internet will evolve in the future both as a medium to deliver art and as a networked culture? Do you know what you will work on next?
		</p>

		<p class="answer">
			I consider the Net (the internet as you know it) is a lost ground. I have since moved onto the BioNet,
			well, another corporate scheme to take over human body as hostage and enslave red blood cells into
			computing units. There have been much cry about post-net, post-digital, post-media, but indeed, where to move/return onto?  I am currently working on my third feature length film <a href="http://fluidthemovie.com" target="_blank"> LUIDÃ˜ </a> that sets its liquid future in 2060. "In the BioNet era, nourishment is a packaged liquid sliding down tubes from source to orifice. All things needed are built into the body - living apps that are injected with liquid, bypassing even hardware installation and ready to be updated and added to at will. Codes are rewritten to reengineer human body functions. The future here contains what is needed within and on the body, including hands imbedded with iris scanners, zipper tattoos that can actually open to become a communication medium, memory drives are teardrops encoding into contact lenses. The open conduits of tubes, not wires, compose the BioNet era. Cypher punk code hacking data hunting takes human body as battleground, the final frontier." - my concept notes for the movie.
